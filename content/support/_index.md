Most bitcoiners need _some_ help with or want to learn more about buying, storing, or using Bitcoin. There's often one tool they just haven't had the time to research or try on their own. Or maybe they don't have the confidence to put that feature into practice. There are a multitude of resources on these topics, sharing reliable tools and best practices (such as [bitcoin.page](bitcoin.page), [bitcoiner.guide](bitcoiner.guide), and [BTC Session's](https://www.youtube.com/c/btcsessions) videos), but it could take 100s of hours to find, consume, and understand the info specific to your needs. 

Save yourself many hours and potentially a lot of frustration by speaking with someone experienced with self-custody and who understands the trade-offs of the tools available.

My name is Corey (aka Corey San Diego on [X](twitter.com/inpharmaticist) and [Nostr](https://primal.net/p/npub1c0r3ytrr4afgrlhrhyec6y9wvkckdllx7ul3cfevtsgjqcrhx8tsdzqs7w)). I have been the host of the San Diego Bitcoiners meetup since 2021, and a bitcoin enthusiast since 2017. I have spent countless hours reading about, listening to, and experimenting with resources in the space. 
I specialize in
1. Mitigating single points of failure
2. Reducing trust
3. Improving privacy
4. Implementing redundancies
5. Executing a maintenance plan
6. Inheritance planning.

I'm here to share what I've learned with you. Cut through the noise and get started today with a better Bitcoin setup. Are you: 
* New to Bitcoin?
* Less than 100% confident in your wallet setup?
* Struggling with a new tool?

If you answer _yes_ to any of the questions above, you might benefit from hands-on support from an experienced Bitcoin enthusiast.  
Reach out for a free consultation. After that, if we identify areas of improvement I will propose recommended changes, walk you through execution, and be there for you afterward if you have further questions.

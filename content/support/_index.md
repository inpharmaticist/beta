Most bitcoiners need _some_ help with or want to learn more about buying, storing, or using Bitcoin. There's often one tool they just haven't had the time to research or try on their own. Or maybe they don't have the confidence to put that feature into practice. There are a multitude of resources on these topics, sharing reliable tools and best practices (such as bitcoin.page, bitcoiner.guide, and [BTC Session's](https://www.youtube.com/c/btcsessions) videos), but it could take 100s of hours to find, consume, and understand the info specific to your purpose. 

Save yourself many hours an potentially a lot of frustration by speaking with someone experienced with self-custody and who understands the tradeoffs of the tools available.

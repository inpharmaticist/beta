> Bitcoin is different things to different people.
> â€” Jameson Lopp

Whatever Bitcoin is to you and wherever you are in your understanding, the San Diego Bitcoiners are here for you! Born out of the Covid pandemic at a time when Bitcoiners needed to get back to rubbing elbows, this meetup served as a means to gather folks who were interesting in talking and learning about Bitcoin, and _only_ Bitcoin!

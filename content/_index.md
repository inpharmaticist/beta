Whatever Bitcoin is to you and wherever you are in your Bitcoin journey, the San Diego Bitcoiners are here for you! Born out of the Covid pandemic at a time when Bitcoiners needed to get back to rubbing elbows, this meetup set out to serve as a means to gather folks who were interesting in talking and learning about Bitcoin, and _only_ Bitcoin!

Take a look at our events page to see when we're meeting next. Our current cadence is the second Thursday of the month at [Quantum Brewing](https://www.quantumbrewingsd.com/) in Kearny Mesa. We have guest presentations, short demos, and sometimes just hang out and chat with each other.

Check out their [Best Practices](https://sparrowwallet.com/docs/best-practices.html) section. This information is great for new people and seasoned Bitcoiners.  They propose 3 general stages based on the value of your Bitcoin savings:
